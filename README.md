a chatbot my Yu Pan

This is a chatbot named "Mike". You can have some basic conversation with it. To expand this chatbot's functionality, I added some additional module that I wrote myself. With these modules, the chatbot is able do some simple tasks such as:

-Tossing a dice of the sizes you need

-Enciphering/deciphering by adding a certain integer to the Unicode code point to each character in your message. (said integer is called "key" in my project)

-Deciphering an encoded message without knowing the key through trying out possible keys one by one until the message makes sytatic sense. (this function might fail if the message is too short or influenced by other factors)

Side note: Considering that this is the best way to demonstrate my project, I didn't put the following code into a separate python file which can be executed with the terminal. The following code puts together many other elements from files in chatbot_modules.
